NEXT.JS DASHBOARD

Chap 1

PREREQUISITES
    - Install a package manager in the project
    --> npm install -g pnpm




FOLDER STRUCTURE
    - /app folder 
        --> all routes, components, logic
    - /app/lib    
        --> reusable functions, data fetching functions
    - /app/ui     
        --> UI components, fonts
    - /public     
        --> static assets such as images

Note: Next.js uses Typescript




PLACEHOLDER DATA
    - Use placeholder data as alternative for database data
    - Can be found in /app/lib folder
    - Sample sources:
        --> JSON 
        --> MockAPI
        --> Prisma
    - In placeholder-data.ts, each Javascript object represents a table in the database 
    - For example:
        const invoices = [
            {
                customer_id: customer[0].id,
                amount: 9999,
                status: 'pending,
                date: '2021-01-01'
            },
            {...}
        ];

    + DEFINITION OF TYPES
        - In Typescript, we can define the types that will be returned from the database
        - For example:
            export const Invoice = {
                id: string;
                customer_id: string;
                amount: number;
                status: 'pending' | 'paid';
                date: string;
            };
        - This is done to ensure that we don't accidentally pass wrong data format to components, like passing
          a string to 'Amount' instead of a number.




RUNNING THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER
    - Run pnpm i in the project folder
    - Run pnpm dev

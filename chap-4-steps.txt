NEXT JS DASHBOARD

Chap 4

ROUTING AND NESTED ROUTING
    - The app/dashboard/invoices is relative to website.com/dashboard/invoices
    - The app/page.tsx is important when creating routes, and each route can have their own layout.tsx and page.tsx
    - For example:
        --> app/
                page.tsx            --> this is equal to /
                dashboard/
                    page.tsx        --> this is equal to /dashboard




LAYOUT
    - Creating a layout.tsx in the /app folder allows nested routes to share the same layout
    - This is also uses the feature of Next.js which is partial rendering, which means the app layout doesnt need to be re-rendered when accessing routes
